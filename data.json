This comprehensive guide is designed to assist new users, particularly administrators for innovative firms, in becoming productive quickly. The onboarding process ensures a smooth integration into the platform, providing access to essential features for managing the ecosystem.\n\n### Detailed Steps for Onboarding\n1. **Invitation or Registration**: Start by creating an account using a work email. Navigate to the Innovate Rwanda link provided by your organization: https://innovate.uat2.techclick.rw/en. Enter your email and password, then click Login. Upon successful login, you will return to the landing page with your username displayed in the marked space.\n\n2. **Email Verification**: Click the verification link sent to your email to confirm ownership and enhance account security. If the email is not received, check your spam folder or request a resend from the login page.\n\n3. **Profile Setup**: Complete your profile by entering your name, role, and organization details. Adjust personal preferences such as language and time zone to tailor your experience. Access your profile by clicking on your username and selecting Account to view and edit details.\n\n4. **Selecting Workspace or Role**: Choose your ecosystem or team if applicable. For admins, select the appropriate role, such as admin for innovative firms, to unlock relevant features.\n\n5. **Accessing the Admin Dashboard**: Click on your username, then select Dashboard from the dropdown list. This will direct you to the Innovate Rwanda Admin Dashboard, featuring the navigation menu on the left side.\n\n6. **Quick Tour of the Platform**: Explore key sections including the Dashboard, Companies, Investors, Enablers, and Opportunities. The Dashboard provides an ecosystem overview with recent activity summaries, key metrics (e.g., total users, hubs, funding raised, employment figures, active firms, active users, funding rounds, verified hubs), and insights such as program role distribution, programs per hub, and project start trends.\n\n### Common Issues and Solutions\n- **Login Problems**: Utilize the 'Forgot Password?' option on the login screen to reset your password. Enter your email, follow the provided link, and set a new strong password.\n- **Dashboard Access Issues**: Ensure you are logged in with administrative credentials. If the dashboard is not visible, verify your role permissions in the settings.\n- **ESO-Specific Onboarding**: Select the correct role during setup to access features like program management or performance tracking.\n- **Interrupted Onboarding**: The platform preserves session data, allowing you to resume from your last point upon the next login.\n\n> Tip: Administrators can pre-assign roles to expedite access for new users. If you encounter persistent issues, refer to the troubleshooting section or contact support for assistance.\n\n### Best Practices for New Users\n- Familiarize yourself with the navigation menu to quickly access different modules.\n- Regularly update your profile to maintain accurate information.\n- Explore the dashboard metrics to gain insights into the ecosystem's health and activity."
